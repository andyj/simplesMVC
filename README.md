Simple MVC for NodeJS using Hogan-express



This work is based off Tim Robers ([@timstermatic](http://www.twitter.com/timstermatic) ) "A Simple MVC Framework With Node and Express" [timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/)

The only changes i've made is 

1. to expand it out to use Hogan-Express instead of Jade (I just find it a painful hinderance) 
2. Remove the mongoose reference for now
3. Expanded the project to act as a skeleton
4. Added a config file in config/index.js



Calling and setting environment

* node app.js dev
* node app.js staging
* node app.js production
